First repository, following tutorial. Ego vinces regno meo.

My name is Adriel Tosi. I am a Brazilian begginer, currently based in Italy, but no for long, for I am going to live in Germany. I am interested im programming user interface and menaging groups. As I have said, I shall conquer my kingdom.
